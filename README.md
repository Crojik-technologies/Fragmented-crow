# Fragmented-crow
## The official FCROW21 repository
### The whitepaper:
#### Instead of miners, there are fragments generated by the ` setup`*`network name`* `()` function with a special `ID` specific to the fragment.
#### The fragments are represented by `turtles` from python's library. It looks amazing, FYI.
#### So far only the North American PHO network and the *`G--`ª* network has fragment avaliability.
#### Fragments can be hosted from anywhere.
#### Networks:
#### *  PHO: _North America_ (USA, MEX, CAN)
#### *  NOD: _PRC_ (People's Republic of China)
#### *  GHO: _Asia_ (excluding PRC)
#### *  EGH: _Europe_
#### *  KI+: _Everywhere else_ (contains G--)
#### *  G--: _Dark network(s)_
##### Fragment Identification:
###### 1???- PHO
###### 2???- G--
###### 3???- GHO
###### 4???- KI+
###### 5???- EGH
###### 6???- NOD
###### 7-9???- PHO
###### 1234- Deus Mons fragment

#####    ªThe G-- network is to be used as a deep network, not a illegal network. Hosted by ID-less servers in undisclosed locations.

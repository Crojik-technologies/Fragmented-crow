# Fragmented-crow
## The official FCROW21 repository
### The whitepaper:
#### Instead of miners, there are fragments generated by the ` setup`*`network name`* `()` function with a special `ID` specific to the fragment.
#### The fragments are represented by `turtles` from python's library. It looks amazing, FYI.
#### So far only the North American PHO network and the *`G--`ª* network has fragment avaliability.
#### Fragments can be hosted from anywhere.
#### Networks:
#### *  NOD: _PRC_ (People's Republic of China)
#### *  GHO: _Asia_ (excluding PRC)
#### *  EGH: _Europe_
#### *  KI+: _Everywhere else_
#### *  G--: _Dark network(s)_
#####    ªThe G-- network is to be used as a deep network, hosted by ID-less servers in undisclosed locations.

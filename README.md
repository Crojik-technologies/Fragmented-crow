# Fragmented-crow
## The official FCROW21 repository
### The whitepaper:
#### Instead of miners, there are *`fragment()`s* with a special *`ID`* specific to the fragment.
#### The fragments are represented by *`turtles`* from python's library. It looks amazing, FYI.
#### So far only the North American PHO network has fragment avaliability.
#### Fragments can be hosted from anywhere.
